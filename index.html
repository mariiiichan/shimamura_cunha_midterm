	<title>Coffee or not to coffee? THAT is the question.</title>

	<h2>
		Have you ever had a project that you didn't work on until the last possible second? Did you ever spend an all nighter working on something you wished you started earlier? Me too. That's where coffee comes in. Coffee is a sweet liquid heaven. You can have different kinds of coffee. Some with espresso in it, make it a latte, anything you wish. I personally take coffee with 2 milk, 2 sugar. Or the Canadian term, double double. Can't function before 10 am? Double double is your answer.

	<h3>Coffee can be an addiction that people can't get over. Some people prefer flavoured water or simply just tea. Tea is also a caffienated drink that people enjoy.</h3>

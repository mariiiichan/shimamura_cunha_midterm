<h1> Coffee or not to coffee? That is the question</h1>
	<h3>
	Please don't!
	First of all, I need to say that the color of coffee isn't good. I mean, that's mean nothing. Isn't shine, isn't invite to you deeply, isn't show you the good things. That color means that it is just dirty water for me. And about the taste? Ugh! Like i said, dirty water, with sugar or not. About the taste, let me see... nothing. They said that when you like some drink that is because remember you something. Coffee just remember me my mom forcing me to drink while I eating a piece of bread before go to bed. My brothers and I don't eat too much in our childhood because we always prefering play, all the times, all the situations. So, this made my mom crazy and she usuaaly trietd to put something down in our throuht. I need to confess, I used drink coffee at work. Specially when I had meeting after lunch - in Brazil that's the main meal, the opportunity you have to eat a lot. Then, meetings after ate a delicious pasta or a big bief with rice, a gorgeous salad and chocolate for dessert was a problem, and the salvation was a cup of coffee for sure.

		Have you ever had a project that you didn't work on until the last possible second? Did you ever spend an all nighter working on something you wished you started earlier? Me too. That's where coffee comes in. Coffee is a sweet liquid heaven. You can have different kinds of coffee. Some with espresso in it, make it a latte, anything you wish. I personally take coffee with 2 milk, 2 sugar. Or the Canadian term, double double. Can't function before 10 am? Double double is your answer.

	<h2>Coffee is not the answer</h2>
	<h3>Coffee can be an addiction that people can't get over. Some people prefer flavoured water or simply just tea. Tea is also a caffienated drink that people enjoy.</h3>
